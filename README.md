Things to note:

-The level cap is 50, the HP cap is 2500, and the money cap is 19999. The damage cap is 999999, and Surpassing Power is always in effect.

-Stats slightly increase every five levels. HP and SP do not increase with levels.

-If an enemy has a sidestep buff, they do not dodge physical skills, only normal attacks/incidental attack etc. Sidestep still works as normal for players.

-NPC inventories either have a 100% steal rate or they can only be bought. Things that can be stolen can be bought for 0 leaves (except Therion main quest items)

-You get a Spurning Ribbon after beating the first boss.
 
Unfinished Content/Issues:

-Galdera, the Gate of Finis bosses and Werner are quite unfinished at the moment. Werner should be fixed very soon but the Gate might take me a while.

-Currently no enemy resists Panic/Shock. There aren't supposed to be many in the first place, but just so you know.

-You can technically cheese the lack of money in the early game by spamming save and quit with Tressa in your inventory, just like vanilla. This'll probably be changed eventually but for now, eh, it's probably slower than Cait farming.

-There are probably a fair amount of incorrect text boxes, including stat numbers.

-Solopath items are currently not available, but I guess you can try anyway?
